This includes the carefully guided redevelopment of some of the area\u2019s large sites, strategic extensions of public water service, and improvements to the area\u2019s transportation network that help to disperse concentrated traffic and improve conditions on major roadways. \n\nThe Walker Planning Commission will hold their regularly scheduled meeting at 7:00 pm that night, immediately following the Open House, in the second-floor meeting room of Fire Station # 2, rather than their usual meeting location in the City\u2019s Commission Chambers.  The Planning Commission will discuss public feedback received from the Open House. The Planning Commission will also review progress on planning efforts related to the Alpine Avenue neighborhood cluster. \n","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/619146158568380\/"},{"id":"316642081819137_1369833223166679","from":{"name":"City of Walker, Michigan","id":"316642081819137"},"name":"GRBJ: Community leaders emphasize Alpine Avenue growth","message":"\"To prevent continued decline and allow Alpine Avenue to adapt to ongoing changes, community leaders are creating a vision for growth in the area between Interstate 96 and 4 Mile Road\".\n\nContinue reading: https:\/\/on.wzzm.com\/2JeJyZr\nWalker 2040 Masterplan: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2Jkv0r6","created_time":"2019-07-01T17:17:54+0000","description":"City of Walker 2040 master plan will focus on area between Interstate 96 and 4 Mile Road.","link":"https:\/\/on.wzzm.com\/2JeJyZr"},{"id":"316642081819137_1369720716511263","from":{"name":"City of Walker, Michigan","id":"316642081819137"},"name":"Timeline Photos","message":"We're hiring! \nThe Department of Public Works is looking for a full-time general laborer.
