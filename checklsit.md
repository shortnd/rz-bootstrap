###A little checklist to make sure that everything has been modified after development is completed:

1. Add share button to site
    * Make sure that the colors match the site as well.
2. Clean up the directories from unused `plugins`, `fonts`, and `css files`
3. If using the weather widget, remember to remove the `README.md` file from the plugin
4. Change information at the top of layout.css and scripts.js
5. Check if client is an existing client before sendoff
6. Change `.html` extensions to `.php` after uploading to the server
